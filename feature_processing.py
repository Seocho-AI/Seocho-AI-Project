class BreedsDataFeatureProcessor():
    """
    A class used to transform data from the Dogtime dataset. Formats data into
    one hot encoded style feature matrices and vector. Ultimately for usage with
    numpy's linear algebra math functions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    breeds__data : DataFrame
        data frame of breeds rating data from dogtime
    user_survey_data : DataFrame
        data frame of user data from our web service's survey
    adopted_data : DataFrame
        data frame of adopted data from animal protect system (or each center's)
    abandoned_data : DataFrame
        data frame of abandoned dogs data from animal protect system
    target_user : str
        string of user's unique id that we're trying to provide recommendations for

    Methods
    -------
    transform_adopted_dogs()
        Finds all dogs which has been adopted before. This returns 2 things as a tuple:
        1) Transforms adopted dogs categories into a one hot encoded feature matrix
        where columns correspond to categories and rows are different dogs
        2) Transforms those same adopted dogs into vector of breed ratings

    transform_entire_breeds_features() : breeds features + abandoned features
        Goes through entire DataFrame of self.breeds_data and transforms all dogs into
        a feature matrix. Will be used to score recommendations based on user weights
        for the top recommendations.
